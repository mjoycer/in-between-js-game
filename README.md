## How to Play the Game

The game reveals two cards.
Player decides to bet any amount. 

The game will show a third card.

The game is over when the player has no more coins. 

The value of the cards are as follows:
```
A= 1, J=11, Q=12, K=13, and the number cards will have the same value as their number.
